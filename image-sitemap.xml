      <image:title>Kilimanjaro & Maasai - Top View</image:title>
      <image:caption>
        Kilimanjaro & Maasai is an original landscape inspired by my expedition to Mt. Kilimanjaro, featuring the majestic mountain and the spirit of the Maasai. Painted on a cow skull using a palette of beige, red, and yellow, with textured palette knife work that enhances the natural 3D effect of the skull's surface. Finished with a golden metallic coating to evoke an antique, weathered texture. The horns are wrapped in authentic sisal rope and adorned with decorative elements sourced directly from Tanzania.
        Medium: Oil, Acrylic, and Metallic Paint on Cow Skull with Sisal Rope
        Dimensions: 38x52 cm
        Currently held in a private collection.

        Purification is an original landscape artwork depicting a serene birch forest, painted on an authentic cow skull. The composition blends shades of purple, red, and white, creating a vivid and atmospheric scene.
        Using a palette knife, textured layers were sculpted to enhance the natural contours of the skull, giving the painting a striking 3D effect. The piece is finished with a subtle metallic coating, adding a soft, ethereal shimmer that shifts with the light.
        Medium: Oil, Acrylic, and Metallic Paint on Cow Skull
        Dimensions: 30x40 cm.
